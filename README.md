# COCC_MOBILE

This is the updated version of the COCC Mobile app. It has been ported to the new gradle build sytem. It has been made easier to work with importing 3rd party libraries. The main new portion of the app is the chat functionality. As of now it is using the Smack API (not Asmack!!). The setting in the connection for the XMPP server have only been tested on LAN newtworks. In order to get a connection changes will need to be made to the file. It is still a work in progress. Looking forward to updating the UI to look modern and sleek. The next step is to add a navigation drawer for ease of acces and quick changing between screens (activities).
